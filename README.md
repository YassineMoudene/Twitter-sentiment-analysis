# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, Twitter stands as a vibrant platform where diverse opinions, emotions, and sentiments converge in real-time. Unraveling the sentiments expressed in tweets has become a pivotal task for understanding public perception, gauging market trends, and even monitoring societal sentiments on various issues.

This project aims to harness the power of two robust machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression and XGBoost — to dissect and interpret the sentiment hidden within the vast sea of tweets. The primary goal is to develop a sophisticated sentiment analysis model capable of classifying tweets into distinct sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. By leveraging logistic regression and XGBoost, we aim to create models that not only discern sentiments accurately but also provide insights into the factors influencing sentiment dynamics on Twitter.
